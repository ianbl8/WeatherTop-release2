# WeatherTop: Release 2

This is **Release 2** of the WeatherTop web application, which meets the following criteria:

This builds on **Release 1**:
- **Readings**: Code, Temperature, Wind Speed, Wind Direction and Pressure fields are all used
- **Stations**: The station name and current readings are displayed for each station in a grid. This uses text terms for the weather, and displays the temperature in 째C and 째F, the wind speed in the Beaufort scale, the wind direction as a compass bearing, the wind chill in 째C and 째F, and pressure in hPa. A table listing all readings for the station appears below the grid.
- **Member**: *not for this version*
- **Features**: Initial station details and readings are read from `/conf/data.yml`. The Dashboard page displays a station list with folder buttons to open each station's page, and a section to add a new station (name only). The Station pages include a section to add readings for that station.
- **Code**: Files have been pushed to a Github repo using SmartGit (Sourcetree is sadly not available on Linux).
